# NvChad UI Plugin 

This ui plugin is a collection of many UI modules like statusline, tabline, cheatsheet, nvdash and much more!

## Tabufline

- Mix of tabline & bufferline. 
- Each tab will have its own set of buffers stored, and the tabufline will show those only.
- Think of it like workspaces on Linux/Windows where windows stay in their own workspaces, but in vim buffers from all tabs will be shown in every tab!

- Statusline with 4 different styles

## Lsp Signature

- Minimal signature window ( [50 LOC ~](https://github.com/NvChad/ui/blob/v3.0/lua/nvchad/lsp/signature.lua)), just uses `vim.lsp.buf.signature_help` on some autocmds.
